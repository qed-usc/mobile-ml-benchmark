# mobile-ml-benchmark

This repository contains inference latency measurements for 102 real-world CNNs, 1000 synthetic CNNs, 69 real-world ViTs and 1000 synthetic ViTs across 174 diverse experimental environments on mobile platforms, accounting for critical factors affecting inference latency, including hardware heterogeneity, data representations and ML frameworks.
